# Elected-Official-Finder
This program will return a user's elected officials based on zip code


Eventually, I would like for this program to evolve into a system that can send weekly/monthly updates 
on a given user's elected officials' voting records.

For example, living in Texas, my senators are Ted Cruz and John Cornyn and my representative is Dan Crenshaw. 
I would like to be able to receive a report at the end of each month via email or some other method that provides 
the voting record from that month for these individuals. Ideally, the user will be able to select which officials 
they would like to keep tabs on.

I think this program could help your typical voter be more educated on what their congresspeople are up to 
and as such they will be able to hold them more accountable.
